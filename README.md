ðŸš€ E-commerce Platform Using Python OOPs ðŸ›’ðŸ’»

I recently built a console-based e-commerce platform using Object-Oriented Programming in Python.
This project covers user authentication and shopping cart functionality in a structured, modular way.

1. User Registration & Login
2. View Available Products
3. Add / Remove Items from Cart
4. View Cart with Total Cost
5. Checkout Process

âœ¨ What this project does:

ðŸ”‘ Secure User Authentication â€“ Register and login with username & password.
ðŸ“¦ Product Management â€“ View a product catalog with IDs, names, and prices.
ðŸ›’ Cart Operations â€“ Add products, remove products, and view items in your cart with the total cost.
Checkout â€“ Place an order with a simple confirmation.

ðŸ’¡ Key Concepts Applied:

1. Classes & Objects for structured code
2. Encapsulation to keep data safe
3. Basic Inheritance (Store class extending Product)
4. List & Dictionary data structures for cart and user storage
5. Menu-driven CLI program for interaction

ðŸš€ Why I built this:
 I wanted to simulate a mini version of how e-commerce backends work â€” from user onboarding to order placement. 
 This helped me practice Python OOP in a practical way while reinforcing my logic-building skills.

ðŸ”® Future Improvements:
Add file or database storage for persistent user and product data.
Integrate payment gateway simulation.

Create a GUI or web interface for a better user experience.
ðŸ’¬ If youâ€™re also learning Python, try building small, realistic projects like this make concepts stick much faster!
